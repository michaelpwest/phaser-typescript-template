---

I created this Phaser 4 template for developers who want to build and deploy mobile games using [Phaser 4](https://phaser.io/) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/). The template includes a range of useful features such as mobile deployment with a custom app icon, responsive scaling for all screen sizes, persistent settings storage, multiple locales support, and debugging options.

The default game is a simple tap to jump game where the aim is to avoid the oncoming obstacles.

A big thank you to [Kenney Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets/) and [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) for providing the graphics and sounds for the game.

## üíª Demo <a id="demo"></a>

A demo of the game is available under https://mwestapps.com/phaser-demo/

## ‚ú® Template features <a id="template-features"></a>

### Frameworks

- **TypeScript:** The game is fully written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/).
- **Vite:** [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is used as the local development server, allowing for automatic reloading when files are modified.
- **Code standards:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) are used to keep the code adhering to its defined rules. When committing changes to Git, [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged/) will confirm that everything is correct before allowing the commit.

### Mobile Support

- **Deploy to mobile:** [Capacitor by Ionic](https://capacitorjs.com/) is used for mobile deployment, with commands like `npm run deploy:ios` and `npm run deploy:android` available for simple mobile deployment.
- **App icon:** An app icon can be added to `resources/icon.png` and will be generated in the necessary formats for iOS or Android when deploying to mobile.
- **Saving storage to mobile:** Mobile storage is supported for saving storage such as the high score chosen locale.
- **Scaling to mobile:** Any mobile device in landscape will scale and display the game correctly, setting up a playable area using a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Locales

- **Multiple locales:** English and Spanish translations have been added to the game. Additional locales can be added to the `src/locales` directory and configured under `src/index.ts`.

### Debug

Under `src/config/debug.ts` you can toggle the following debug options:

- **Disable menu:** You can have the game start automatically without having to select `Start Game` by setting `disableMenu: true`.
- **Disable sound:** You can disable sounds by setting `disableSound: true`.
- **FPS:** The game will be locked to 60 FPS and you can enable the FPS counter by enabling `fps: true`.
- **Physics:** You can enable physics graphics such as hit boxes by setting `physics: true`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation <a id="installation"></a>

Install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

## üíæ Development <a id="development"></a>

Start the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

Once the game is running, open your browser and go to:

```
localhost:3000
```

Any files changes you make will reload the development server automatically.

## üì± Mobile deployment <a id="mobile-deployment"></a>

If you use this template for building a new game, make sure the game is deployed with the correct name, version, author, and app icon:

- Confirm everything is correct under `package.json`. The fields `name`, `version` and `author` are the most important to verify.
- Make sure `capacitor.config.ts` has the correct `appId` and `appName`.
- Add an app icon to `resources/icon.png`.

[Capacitor by Ionic](https://capacitorjs.com/) is used for mobile deployment and depending on which mobile operating system you wish to deploy to, you can create the [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) project with:

```
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

You can open the project to make any changes directly in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/):

```
npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

To deploy to either mobile operating system you can run:

```
npm run deploy:ios
npm run deploy:android
```

## üåê Web deployment <a id="web-deployment"></a>

To deploy the game to a web server you can run:

```
npm run build
```

The build will be added to the `dist` directory and its contents can be uploaded to a web server.
